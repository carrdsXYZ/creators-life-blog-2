## People’s faith in creators is demonstrative of how trust is changing in the world.

People increasingly turn from textbooks and traditional media to content creators. At first, content served as a gateway to another target for the consumer. Sometimes it was enjoyment or entertainment. Sometimes, it’s building confidence before making the decision to complete a purchase. At other times, the content is used to learn complicated subjects like [Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) and [Geopolitics](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaspianReport), or simple tasks like [Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/c/bingingwithbabish) and [How to Groom Your Beard](https://www.youtube.com/user/labsalon).

But as consumers came back again and again to watch the content of the same creator; Patterns of fandom emerged:
- **Admiration.** People become attracted to creators. Creators represent characteristics that they aspire to. Creators exemplify the person consumers want to be.
- **Connection.** People are interested in the creators. Creators have the ability to engage consumers with attention through different platforms. They are authentic and relatable and make consumers feel like they know them. Consumers want to make deeper, more personal connections to them.
- **Belonging.** When people congregate habitually, and stoke fandom in each other, that is the beginning of a community. Once fans engage with one another a true belonging is starting to build. Fans share experiences, content, and thoughts among themselves while creators have more opportunities to deepen relationships and create an environment where people feel they truly belong.

This behavior totally changed the power dynamic between traditional brands and creators in favor of creators and empowered them to think of content creation as a legitimate business. 

No longer do consumers default to known brands with big marketing budgets. Instead, their faith lies with a single individual, whom they form bonds with through content and community. In response, brands are relying more on creators as a medium of building brand awareness, consideration, and favorability with consumers. 

Creators are becoming the new brands.
