## Creators invest in building a home for their fans.

Once creators have internalized their audience [fandom pattern of behavior](/blog/post2/) they started solidifying communities around their business. Many have started being active in building homes for their communities, moving their top fans off social networks and into self-owned platforms.

They continued to leverage social network platforms like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc., as channels to get to and engage with their audience, but use other tools like Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, Subreddits, website, mailing list, etc., to organize their community. Everyone in the community is part of the creator’s audience. But, not everyone in their audience is part of the community.

**The dynamic of this process is straightforward:**
1. The creator makes something valuable to a large enough audience in a niche subject for free.
2. An initial audience starting to emerge, and people are becoming more engaged with the creator over social platforms. 
3. A community is starting to form around the creator Through *admiration, connection,* and *belonging*.
4. Creator port fans to a self-owned platform.

In that sense, communities might be described more as a *fandom*. Its members are *Super Fans.* They are more likely to follow the creator through multiple social channels and are more likely to share their content. They know the creator’s background story, cares about what’s next for them, and are personally interested in the niche subject matter. They are also more likely to support the creator as a business.

Creators enjoy a high level of trust among their community, and their recommendations serve as a form of social proof. This level of involvement in other community members’ lives effectively positions the creators as *owners of a community organized around shared interests and tastes*.
